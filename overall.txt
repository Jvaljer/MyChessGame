How to implement ? 
(using an Object Oriented Prog modeling ??)

creating : 
    Board.h 
    Token.h 
    -> we'll need to add some slots 
        Slot.h
    -> and slots could be defined as coord (with other statements ?)
        Coord.h 
    => + an overall behaviour handler ? 
        Game.h 

so need these files : 
    Coord.h --> just two int (x,y) 
        methods ?: Equality, Neighbour, Diag, Getter&Setter.s 
    Slot.h  --> defined with a coord ? + other statements ?
        methods ?:  (same as coord but typed for slot)
    Token.h --> defined as role + color & with a Slot/Coords ?? + an id ?
        methods ?: getId (role+color), Getter&Setter.s, ...
    Board.h --> defined as a Slot's grid
        methods ?: getSlot, Getter&Setter.s, ...
    Game.h  --> defined as a Board & a list of tokens
